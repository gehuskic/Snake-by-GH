A recreation of the iconic snake game, but in higher resolution! This project was made possible with the built-in python module Turtle. This project is my first successful attempt at making a functional game/app, where the sole interaction is through a GUI. I made use of multiple classes inheriting each other, and separating each part of the on-screen elements as their own objects.
